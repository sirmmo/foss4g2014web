## Request for Quotation/Qualifications

In September, 2014, Portland will be hosting the Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial Conference (FOSS4G). 2014 will also be the conference's 10th anniversary.

FOSS4G is the premiere international conference for open source geospatial technology. We are anticipating more than 1,000 attendees from around the world, and we're looking forward to introducing them to Portland and showing them why we love this city. 

The organizing committee is soliciting bids for design services. The initial scope will be to design a logo for the conference, including variations for different display purposes (web banner, badge, greyscale, etc). Future work may include other design services such as signage, banners, website layout, printed programs, and t-shirt design.

### Design Requirements

We're looking to maintain a consistent identity for the conference while highlighting those things that make Portland unique. We are looking for exciting designs — we don't want just another boring conference logo. There is just one requirement: any design must include the FOSS4G Ribbon. The ribbon [can seen here](https://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/foss4g/main/logos/ribbon.png). Examples of logos from past years [can be seen here](https://svn.osgeo.org/osgeo/foss4g/main/logos/) – but don't feel constrained by those designs.

The final design for the base logo should be completed by September 17th, with variations due shortly thereafter.

### Bid Requirements

Interested parties should include a portfolio of relevant past work, and a quotation for the logo design, including variations. Please note if you are interested in doing future related work, such as t-shirt design, program design and layout, etc. You may include estimates for these services in your bid, but it is not required, and these will not be part of the initial contract.

We will start evaluating submissions as soon as they arrive. No submissions will be accepted after September 1st, and we may choose a submission at any time before that. Prompt replies are encouraged.

Please address questions and send bid materials to:
